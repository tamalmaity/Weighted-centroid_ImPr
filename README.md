This project is basically a Power System Design problem. 

The road segments are considered to be points. These points are then marked on the map of the town we have and then the associated loads are noted down in an excel sheet. The matlab code detects the points from the trace and correlates the assigned indices with the indices assigned in the map. The loads are then pulled from the excel sheet, the centroid calculated and the final point of installation of the transformer is determined by taking into account the ratio of the virtual distance to that of the real map.
